# Dock RFCs and Specs

## RFC

Anyone is free to propose new developments by writing an RFC (request for comment). Submit an RFC by copying and filling the template [rfc/0000-template.md](./rfc/0000-template.md). Create new file `rfc/xxxx-feature-name.md`. When you are ready for your feature to be reviewed, submit a pr.

The team makes a final decidsion after the RFC has been discussed and the benefits and drawbacks are well understood. At that point the rfc is either
- approved (merged)
- rejected (pr is closed)
- or postponed (pr tagged with the "postponed" label and closed)

## Spec

An implementation spec is the optional next step after the RFC. Copy the template [spec/0000-template.md](./spec/0000-template.md) over to `spec/xxxx-feature-name.md` to get started. The spec can be submitted in the same PR as your RFC or it can be submitted separately.

## Markdown Formatting

Couple arbitrary decisions for style consistency:

- Include double line breaks before and after elements e.g. `# Headers` or code blocks.
- Don't perform manual line-wrapping.
