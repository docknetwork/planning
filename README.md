# Dock RFCs and Specs

## RFC

Anyone is free to propose new developments by writing an RFC (request for comment). Submit an RFC by copying and filling the template `rfc/0000-template.md`. Create new file `rfc/xxxx-feature-name.md`. When you are ready for your feature to be reviewed, submit a pr.

## Spec

After an RFC is reviewed, the next step is to submit an implementation spec. Copy the template `spec/0000-template.md` over to `spec/xxxx-feature-name.md` to get started.

## Markdown Formatting

Couple arbitrary decisions for style consistency:

- Include double line breaks before and after elements e.g. `# Headers` or code blocks.
- Don't perform manual line-wrapping.
