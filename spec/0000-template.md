*This document specifies additional details on top of the associated RFC. To avoid repeating things you can always link back to a relevant section of the RFC.*

*This document needs not specify detailed APIs. APIs will be proposed and reviewed within their respective codebases along with unit tests when possible.*

[RFC](../0000-template)

# Design Summary

*No additional info to add. That's ok.*

# Post-RFC Decisions

*Did the RFC leave an implementaion detail unspecified?*

## Plan

*This is the main body of the spec. It splits the problem into pieces.*

*Consider whether this is going to be an imperative or declaritive style plan.*

*It's inevitable that plans be imperfect. In some cases the implementer will need to propose changes to this plan. They can do so in a PR.*

## Time Predictions

*Split implementation into pieces to predict granular time requirements. Sum the predictions to predict a total.*

*Granular time predictions are indended to help _you_ come up with an accurate over-all prediction. This section isn't for communicating technical requirments to the implementer.*



<!-- Make the plan descriptive enough to encourage productive suggestions. -->
<!-- If your tech spec covers low-level topics, consider including HTTP response codes, JSON request/response snippets, and error names. -->
<!-- Measuring Impact -->
<!-- This section defines specific metrics that you expect your project will impact; they should map directly to your goals. At Lyft, engineers collaborate with data scientists and product managers to define these metrics; we are fortunate to have robust data pipelines and analytical tools to facilitate this process. In the early stages of a project, these metrics can help answer difficult questions around prioritization (“Given our finite engineering resources, which feature is more important to build?”). After launch, they become means of gauging the project’s success and identifying areas for improvement. -->
<!-- - Reach 2K twitter followers within 2 months of launch via cross-account and cross-platform promotion. -->
<!-- - At least 50% followers are non-bots; at least 20% are age 18–35 -->
<!-- Security, Privacy, Risks -->
<!-- If the project is external-facing, list the ways in which malicious users could exploit your change. Highlighting the risks of your project can be anxiety-inducing; what if reviewers criticize you for introducing all this risk to the system/product? Still, it’s important to solicit these critiques so that reviewers can pose questions and solutions that will ultimately make your feature more robust. -->
<!-- Other Considerations -->
<!-- Discuss approaches you considered (but ultimately decided against). This serves as a form of documentation and can also preempt suggestions from reviewers to investigate approaches you’ve already discarded. -->
<!-- Spot the Bot Email Bot: emails instead of tweets. Decided not to implement because it doesn’t scale well, and user demand is low. -->
<!-- Milestones -->
<!-- To keep your project on track, divide all work into key accomplishments and assign estimated dates. -->
<!-- - Dog API integration complete: October 14th -->
<!-- - Post interval configurable: October 17th -->
<!-- - QA complete: October 21st -->
<!-- Make this section a source of truth — if a milestone is pushed back, note it here. Keeping milestones up-to-date can prevent misunderstandings about the project’s status and help ensure that the project ships in a reasonable time frame. This is especially useful for larger teams and organizations. -->
<!-- Open Questions -->
<!-- List unresolved design or implementation questions, along with an invitation for reviewers to give feedback. Feel free to call out specific people who may have valuable input. -->
<!-- We’ll start by tweeting once ever hour, on the hour. Can someone on Data Analytics confirm that this rate will maximize our audience? -->

*Final Checklist*
*Can you think of a likely point of disagreement? If so, make sure a stance is stated clearly in this document so team members can argue over it now rather than during implementaion.*
*Try to think of which relevant implementation details are still unstated.*
