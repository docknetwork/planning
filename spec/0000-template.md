*This document specifies additional details on top of the associated RFC. To avoid repeating things you can always link back to a relevant section of the RFC.*

## Design Summary

*No summary comes to mind? That's ok. Just write "None"*

## Post-RFC Decisions

*Did the RFC defer any decisions? You can specify them here or leave them for the implementer to resolve.*

## Spec

*This is the main body of the specification. It splits the problem into pieces.*

*Consider whether this is going to be an imperative or declarative style spec.*

*Examples of type declarations and function signatures may be useful in communicating your vision. This document needs not specify detailed APIs. APIs will be proposed and reviewed within their respective codebases along with unit tests when possible.*

*It's inevitable that plans be imperfect. In some cases the implementer will submit a PR to make changes to the spec.*

## Measuring Impact

*Will the results of this project be measurable. If so, how?*

## Teaching

*How will the completed project be documented? How will new functionalities be demonstrated? Will demos be part of the requirements for this project or will they be proposed in a separate RFC?*

*If the single deliverable for this project is already a demo, you may want to write "NA" for this section.*

## Security, Privacy, Risks

## Milestones

*To keep your project on track, divide all work into key accomplishments and assign time predictions.*
*This section will not stay up to date. Once the project is started, a project manager will track*
*deadlines elsewhere.*

## Open Questions

*Use this section to invite specific feedback from reviewers.*

*Final Checklist*

- *Can you think of a likely point of disagreement? If so, make sure a stance is stated clearly in this document so team members can argue over it now rather than during implementation.*
- *Try to think of which relevant implementation details are still unstated.*
